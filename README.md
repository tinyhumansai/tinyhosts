# TinyHosts

One API for putting a Next.js application — and the database behind it — on a
real hosting provider.

TinyHosts is the hosting category of the TinyHumans stack. OpenHuman vendors it,
OpenCompany inherits it from there, and a user who pastes a provider API key into
OpenCompany gets a live site out of a workspace. It ships both as an ordinary
Rust library and as an installable TinyBus module.

Vercel is the first provider. Adding the next one means implementing one trait.

## What it does

The unit of work is the whole thing, because that is what "host this" means:

| Step | Method | On Vercel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Site | `create_site`, `find_site`, `list_sites` | a project |
| Database | `provision_database`, `attach_database` | a marketplace store, connected to the project |
| Environment | `set_env`, `list_env` | project environment variables |
| Domain | `add_domain`, `list_domains` | a project domain |
| Deployment | `deploy`, `deployment`, `list_deployments`, `promote` | file upload, then a build |
| Traffic | `analytics` | the web analytics query API |

[`launch`](src/launch/mod.rs) runs the five hosting steps in the one order that
works — the database is connected *before* the build, because a Next.js build
reads its environment at build time.

## Using it

```rust
use tinyhosts::{Bundle, DatabaseSpec, LaunchPlan, ProviderKind, SiteSpec, launch};

let host = tinyhosts::connect_from_env(ProviderKind::Vercel)?;

let plan = LaunchPlan::new(SiteSpec::new("shop"), Bundle::from_dir("./shop")?)
    .with_database(DatabaseSpec::new("shop-db"))
    .into_production();

let result = launch(host.as_ref(), &plan).await?;
println!("building at {:?}", result.url());
```

`launch` returns while the build is still running. Poll `Host::deployment` until
its status `is_terminal()`; how long to wait is the caller's policy, so this
crate owns no timer.

Credentials come from `TINYHOSTS_VERCEL_TOKEN`, falling back to `VERCEL_TOKEN`,
with `TINYHOSTS_VERCEL_TEAM_ID` / `VERCEL_TEAM_ID` for a team account. See
[`.env.example`](.env.example). A credential can equally be passed in from a
form, which is what OpenCompany does.

### From another process

`tinyhosts::execute_json` is the same surface as one JSON request and one JSON
result, and the TinyBus `Execute` method is a thin wrapper over it:

```json
{
  "provider": "vercel",
  "credentials": { "api_key": "...", "team": null },
  "operation": "launch",
  "plan": {
    "site": { "name": "shop" },
    "bundle": [{ "path": "package.json", "contents": "e30=" }],
    "database": { "name": "shop-db", "kind": "postgres" },
    "target": "production"
  }
}
```

Bundle file contents are base64. Results are `{"result": "...", "value": ...}`.

## What it will not do

- **Hold a secret.** A database's connection string is injected by the provider
  into the site's environment; this crate only ever learns the *names* of the
  variables. `Credentials` has no `Serialize` and a redacting `Debug`.
- **Pretend.** A capability a provider lacks is an `Unsupported` error naming the
  provider and the capability, never a silent success.
- **Wait, retry, or schedule.** Those are the caller's policy.

## Databases

Vercel does not run databases; its marketplace partners do. `provision_database`
therefore searches the installed integrations on the account for a product that
serves the requested kind — `postgres` matches Neon, Supabase, Prisma Postgres
and friends — creates a store from it, and connects it to the project. If nothing
on the account can serve the kind, the error says exactly that rather than
failing later with a missing `DATABASE_URL`.

Pin a specific product with `DatabaseSpec::with_product` when an account has more
than one that would match.

## Features

`vercel` (default) is the provider. `module` (default) is the TinyBus module —
the bus interface, the ABI exports and the `cdylib` a TinyBus host loads. A
downstream that links the library directly takes
`default-features = false, features = ["vercel"]` and gets no TinyBus in its
graph, which is what OpenHuman does: it vendors its own TinyBus, and two path
copies of one package cannot both be written to a lockfile.

`tools` (off by default) adds `tinyhosts::tools`: the ten `hosting_*` agent tools
as `tinytools::Tool`s over any `Host`, plus `resolve_in_workspace`, which
decides which directory an agent may deploy. A host supplies the `Host` client
and the workspace directory; whether to register the tools, and the approval
gate in front of the four that change the world, stay with it. `tinytools` is a
git dependency so a host that links another checkout of it can `[patch]` the two
into one package.

## Adding a provider

Implement `Host`, add a `ProviderKind` variant, and wire it into `connect_to`.
[`docs/specs/unified-hosting-api.md`](docs/specs/unified-hosting-api.md) maps the
model onto Netlify, Cloudflare, Railway, Render, Fly.io and a self-hosted target,
and says where each one does not fit.

## Development

Clone with submodules, or initialize them before building:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo build --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --all-features
```

Those four are exactly what CI runs. Optional extras:

```sh
cargo run --example basic            # build a launch plan, send nothing
cargo doc --no-deps --all-features   # CI builds this with RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"
cargo deny check all                 # supply-chain check; see deny.toml
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov         # once, before running the coverage gate
.github/scripts/check-file-coverage.sh 90 coverage.json
```

The provider tests run the real adapter against a local mock of the REST API, so
the suite is offline, deterministic, and needs no token.

## Releasing

Run the **Release** workflow from the Actions tab with a `patch`, `minor`, or
`major` bump. Use `current` only to resume an interrupted release whose version
commit and tag already exist. The workflow revalidates the crate, versions and
tags it, builds this crate as a TinyBus `cdylib`, and creates a GitHub release.
Assets follow `tinyhosts-<version>-<platform>.<tar.gz|zip>` and contain the
native module, its SHA-256 `modules.toml`, license, and
[`MODULE.md`](MODULE.md). Every release also publishes `checksum.toml`, which
TinyBus uses to verify an archive before extraction. The workflow loads the
published Ubuntu archive through TinyBus's GitHub release API and calls its
`Providers` method before declaring the release successful. TinyBus itself is not
shipped by this repository; the pinned submodule is the build-time SDK. Do not
hand-edit the version in `Cargo.toml`.

## Minimal host contract

Hosts loading the compiled module depend on `tinyhosts-bus`. It supplies the
existing request/result envelopes, hosting records, errors, provider identifiers,
and tool declarations without linking provider implementations. See the
[contract crate](crates/tinyhosts-bus/README.md) and
[boundary spec](docs/specs/minimal-bus-contract.md).


### Authorized directory preparation

Operation vocabulary 1.1 adds `prepare_bundle` inside the existing single-string
`Execute` request. `Providers()` and `Execute(String)` keep their arities, and
all ten model tool declarations remain unchanged. A trusted host must authorize
a concrete canonical workspace and relative source directory before constructing
`AuthorizedDirectory`. This DTO declares scope; it does not prove authorization.
Do not expose generic `Execute` forwarding or this operation to model arguments.
Host path policy, system-root restrictions and deployment approval remain host
responsibilities, including when optional autonomy policy is disabled.

Preparation returns the actual base64 `bundle`, version, file/byte counts and
examined/skipped entry counts, without credential lookup or provider requests.
Use that exact returned bundle for approval and later `launch`/`deploy`; rereading
the source would invalidate the approved snapshot. There are no leased resources
to release. The library's existing `Bundle::from_dir` behavior is unchanged.
Preparation preserves its directory enumeration order, standard base64 bytes and
build/cache exclusions, adds all `.env.*` files and credential stores to exclusions,
and skips nested symlinks. Unlike the legacy library collector, preparation
refuses symlinks in the workspace or source directory path and rejects every `..`
component. Traversal uses directory handles and opens each component without
following links. Supplied Launch/Deploy bundles also refuse credential stores,
Microsoft credential directories and environment files; absolute Windows paths,
NUL bytes and traversal are rejected by the validated bundle path type.

Limits per preparation are 4 MiB decoded source, 4,096 files, 16,384 examined
entries (including excluded entries), 64 directory levels, 1,024 UTF-8 bytes per
relative path and a conservative 6 MiB serialized snapshot budget. Raw reads are
bounded; escaped paths and base64 expansion are charged before encoded files are
allocated or published. The 6 MiB snapshot budget leaves headroom for at most
twofold nested JSON-string escaping under the 16 MiB TinyBus frame limit. These
preparation limits do not shrink legacy Launch/Deploy request budgets: requests
that fit the existing transport continue to work, including an 8 MiB base64
bundle. Larger *directory preparation* snapshots require a future streaming
protocol; callers may still supply larger bundles through existing operations.
Typed `PreparationPath` and `PreparationLimit` errors explain
refusals. File contents are omitted from preparation Debug output.

The OpenHuman adapter is a separate followup, gated on a published compatible
module artifact and digest. This change does not switch host dependencies or
release package versions.
